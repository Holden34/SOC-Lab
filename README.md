# SOC LAB

## Objective
I designed and deployed a foundational Security Operations Center (SOC) lab environment in Microsoft Azure to gain hands-on experience with security configurations, threat detection, and log data analysis. As part of the lab, I implemented a honeypot on a Windows 10 virtual machine to simulate malicious activity and generate relevant telemetry. I integrated Azure Log Analytics and developed a custom workbook to visualize and analyze the collected data, including tracking failed login attempts, mapping geolocated threat sources, and aligning findings with the MITRE ATT\&CK framework for adversarial behavior analysis.

### Skills Learned

1. **Cloud Security Configuration** – Set up and secured resources within Microsoft Azure, including virtual networks, virtual machines, and access controls.

2. **Threat Detection and Simulation** – Deployed a honeypot to simulate attacker behavior and capture suspicious activity such as brute-force login attempts.

3. **Log Management and Analysis** – Collected and queried security event logs using Azure Log Analytics to identify patterns and anomalies.

4. **Data Visualization** – Built custom workbooks in Azure Monitor to visualize failed login attempts, geolocation mapping, and threat insights.

5. **MITRE ATT\&CK Framework Application** – Mapped observed activities to MITRE ATT\&CK tactics and techniques to better understand and classify adversary behavior.

6. **Network Monitoring and Telemetry Collection** – Monitored inbound connections and network traffic to identify unauthorized access attempts and gather actionable security telemetry.


### Tools Used

1. **Microsoft Azure** – Cloud platform used to host the SOC environment, virtual machines, and networking components.

2. **Azure Log Analytics** – Centralized log collection and analysis tool used to query and interpret security event data.

3. **Honeypot (Windows 10 VM)** – Deceptive system deployed to attract and log unauthorized access attempts for analysis.

4. **Azure Workbooks** – Visualization tool used to create interactive dashboards for monitoring failed logins, geolocation tracking, and threat patterns.
