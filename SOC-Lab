I created a Simple SOC lab in Microsoft Azure in order to practice security configurations and data reading. 
In support of the SOC lab, I created a honey pot and log analytics workbook to provide data for use in the SOC lab.

Here are snippets of monitoring the failed login attempts on the honey pot, a windows 10 machine.
